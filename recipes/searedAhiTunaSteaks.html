    <p>Ahi tuna steaks are extremely easy to make, mostly because they are served rare or medium-rare — they only need to be lightly seared for about one minute on each side.</p>
    <p>Ahi tuna has a mild flavor, so you'll want to make sure you season it before cooking. This recipe seasons the tuna steaks with salt and cayenne pepper, plus sears them in a pan with butter, olive oil, and whole peppercorns. You could also season your ahi tuna steaks with a simple sauce (like teriyaki sauce, orange sauce, or soy sauce).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (5 ounce) ahi tuna steaks</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon whole peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pat tuna steaks dry and season on both sides with salt and cayenne pepper.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and pepper corns; cook until peppercorns soften and pop, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Gently place seasoned tuna in the skillet and cook to desired doneness, anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>Slice tuna into 1/4-inch thick slices to serve.</li>
    </ol>
